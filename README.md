# ProjectsAtMotionCut
THIS IS MY FIRST PROJECT AT MOTIONCUT.
The Objective of this project is to design 'a Price Landing Page' of a Service/Product using the structure of HTML and design using CSS.
I have used the insights of 'div' tag to build the efficient structure.
I have implemented functions in javascript to include the interaction.
It's been a great experience building this page.
